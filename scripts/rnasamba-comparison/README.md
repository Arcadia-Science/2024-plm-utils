# Comparison to RNASamba
This directory contains a script that train and evaluates RNASamba models on the datasets generated by the `smallesm datasets construct` command.

This script is not a module of the main `smallesm` package and indeed it cannot be run in the same environment as the main package because RNASamba depends on tensorflow 1.15.

To set up the environment to run this script, first create a new env from the `rnasamba.yml` file:
```bash
mamba env create -n rnasamba-env -f rnasamba.yml
```

Then activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate rnasamba-env
```

Then install the `rnasamba` package manually:
```bash
pip install --no-deps rnasamba==0.2.5
```
The `rnasamba` package must be installed manually like this because there is no way to specify the `--no-deps` flag in the `rnasamba.yml` file.
