# Test data

This directory contains test datasets that are used for automated testing and can also be used to manually test the commands and functions in the `plmutils` package.

- **`orf_prediction/`**

  This directory contains a small example of the raw data needed for the `orf_prediction` task. This dataset was constructed manually by heavily downsampling several of the transcriptomes used to develop the ORF-prediction methods (see the main README for more details). It can also be used to manually test the generic `plmutils` CLI commands.

- **`transcripts.fa`**

  This file was manually created by selecting three coding transcripts from the downsampled human transcriptome in the test dataset for ORF prediction.

- **`peptides.fa`**

    This file was manually created by selecting three putative ORF sequences generated by `orfipy` from the downsampled human transcriptome in the raw test dataset for ORF prediction.
